<h1><a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h1>

<p>From 2009-2013 I was a student at the University of Chicago.
I currently live in Hyde Park, Chicago and do DevOps work for
<a href="https://globus.org">Globus</a>, a research group based
out of Argonne National Lab and the University of Chicago's
Computation Institute.</p>

<p>At present, my major side project is
<a href="http://salve.sirosen.net">SALVE</a>, a small language
for managing configuration files under a Version Control System.
If you want to learn more about the project, its webpage gives a
comprehensive description.</p>
